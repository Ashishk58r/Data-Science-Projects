GRIPNovember22 The Sparks Foundation

The above file is for the submission for my first task as an Intern at the Sparks Foundation GRIP program for the month of November, 2022.

The dataset contains two columns which are Hours and Scores. We are just required to predict the score of a student who studies for definite duration of time.

In here the question we are answering is, what score would a student get if studies for a duration 9.25 hurs on a daily basis.

From the prediction we have found out that the marks he would be getting would be around 92 which is pretty good.
